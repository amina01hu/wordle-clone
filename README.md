# Wordle Clone

A simple Wordle clone built with Pygame using python. This project replicates the popular word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay with a clean user interface.
- Real-time feedback on guesses (correct letters, positions, etc.).
- Random word generation for each game session.
- Wave-like Win Animation for winning the game

    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.

## How to Play
1. Guess the five-letter word within six attempts.
2. After each guess:
    - Letters in the correct position will be highlighted.
    - Letters in the word but in the wrong position will be marked.
    - Incorrect letters will be grayed out.
3. Use the feedback to refine your guesses.
